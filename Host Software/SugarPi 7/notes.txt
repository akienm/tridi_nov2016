Makefile to automatically run pep8 + mypy might be useful

If you use FileHandler for writing logs, the size of log file will grow with time. Someday, it will occupy all of your disk. In order to avoid that situation, you should use RotatingFileHandler instead of FileHandler in production environment.

Things to work on: 
Making server available on more than just localhost
Rewriting shootstring into buffer form
[DONE] Split utils into utils and camera_utils

If you try to take too many snapshots too quickly from the motion api, it fails
EG- at .2s in between snaps I had a failure rate of 5%
Weird 

CANNOT FTP over iPhone tether (At least that's what I think was going on)
Also when FTP fails, it fails silently- no error message recorder

Master fails if no arduino detected
Uploader fails if no network/ cannot connect to server
Seperate log files for all processes please

Refactor arduino control logic
Implement Z string transfer between ard/etc.

Merge server/master? Probably.

Currently doing /here/is/my/folder_{} a lot
Should probably change that to os.path.join 

Figure out API endpoints- read from file?
Move from config.yml to config.json and state.json - json all the way up!

Verify XML format is correct

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU LEAVE
