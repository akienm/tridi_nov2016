I'm using [coded] to mean that a fix is coded and possibly tested by
the coder, but someone else (ideally the person requesting) should
switch it to [fixed] once it's been verified as fixed.

- random USB drops?  Crashes after overnight

- [This could take (mostly non-billable, but clock time) days and
  depends on the previous item]  Try to reproduce random USB
  drops/serial port hangs in Windows after overnight.

- [Also depends on setting up hardware Windows box].  Hex uploader for
  Windows.  (It works great on Mac/Linux right now, but I don't think
  that helps anyone but me.  :)  This is the alternative to users
  downloading Arduino IDE plus motor libraries and building source
  code themselves.  It will eventually need to be integrated into the
  Host software (by Chad).


Some things that fall below the line (Probably not worth doing until
there is a clear need, because there may never be.  I should get a
contract in place for the stuff I've done that's outside our original
scope, but certainly for this additional work.  Is the new company set
up yet?):

- Automated command-line tests of all commands for continuous
  build/integration.  These would take a while (maybe a full billable
  day) to write, and longer to get fully correct.

- Table-driven commands.  This would have the advantage of making all
  commands and their possible return statuses always consistent with
  the documentation and in-monitor help, but would certainly introduce
  new bugs which would probably impede progress of others.  (This
  effect could be mitigated, but not eliminated, if I wrote the
  automated tests mentioned above.)

- Make D know about all semi-consts: Parsing/setting of Arduino
  variables (motor parameters, debug, verbose, echo, etc.) if we're
  not going to do more engineering fiddling with the motors, tops
  speeds, and accelerations.  We can already set/unset debug, verbose,
  echo, and I think I'm the only one using those.  If we DO get new
  motors, this would be a much higher priority.

- Write standalone uploaoder
  - Find/choose a serial port
    - This could be super automatic, scanning serial ports, etc.
    - Or it could be manual.  Here's the list, pick one.
  - invoke avrdude


- print table of error codes and messages

- Move error codes into defines and a table

- auto test (via make)
  - Write tests for Z and z
  - Make tests pass
