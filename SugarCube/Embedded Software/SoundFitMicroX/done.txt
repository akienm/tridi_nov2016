- F (imaging lamps off) not working, F option missing from switch statement in loop()  [fixed - CU]


- N (imaging lamps on) not working, N option missing from switch statement in loop() [fixed - CU]


- c (check ready status) not working, c option missing from switch statement in loop() [fixed - CU]


- CU: Line 140 of reportStatusToSerial adds an extra newline, which
breaks my code.  For ease of use, when verbose is off, the only
newline should be at the end of the entire string  [fixed - CU]



- Verbose command to take an argument, 0 for off and 1 for on. [fixed - CU]


CU: The default value for verbose should be 0, not 1, to make
 communication with the host software easier [fixed - CU]



- When Verbose is off, make return string have no newlines, rather just
the return code and then the data.  So, right now v returns something
like this: version 2.00

0: statusVersion OK

It would help me if what it returned looked like this
0:statusVersion OK:version 2.00

so return code:message:data. In case of an error data can be empty  I
can then very easily create a standard CubeResponse object inside my
code.  [fixed - CU]




- hook up StatusElevation() and StatusRotation() [coded]



- Using L for the elevate command but it should be E [CU: fixed]
- The Elevate command always returns ERROR_DEFAULT [CU: fixed]
